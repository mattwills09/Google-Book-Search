# Google Book Search React-Based Application
___

This book search application was created as an entirely React-based JavaScript application that allows the user to connect to the Google Books database, search, and save favorite books to a MongoDB, and also the ability to look up the details of almost every book that has ever been published.

It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS framework, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node JS, Axios for the API calls, DotEnv for security, and Heroku for the project hosting.
