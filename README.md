# React Google Book Search Application
___

This project is an entirely React based JavaScript application that allows the user to connect to the Google Books database, search and save favorite books to a MongoDB, and look up the details of almost every book ever published.

It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node JS, Axios for API calls, DotEnv for security, and Heroku for the project hosting.
